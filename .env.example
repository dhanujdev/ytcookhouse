# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values.

# --- Google Gemini API ---
# Your API key for the Google Gemini service.
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_gemini_api_key"

# --- Google Cloud Service Account Credentials (for Google Drive & YouTube) ---
# The application will prioritize Service Account credentials if provided.

# OPTION 1 (Recommended for Render.com and similar platforms):
# Paste the ENTIRE JSON content of your Google Service Account key file here.
# Make sure it's a valid JSON string. For Render/Heroku, you might paste this directly into an env var.
# Example: GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS_JSON_CONTENT='{ "type": "service_account", "project_id": "...', ...}'
# LEAVE THIS BLANK IF USING OPTION 2 or 3 for Google APIs.
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS_JSON_CONTENT=

# OPTION 2 (Alternative for Service Account, if you prefer to use a file path):
# The ABSOLUTE path to your Google Service Account JSON key file.
# If you use this, make sure this file is present in your deployment environment.
# Example: GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON_PATH="/etc/secrets/your-service-account-key.json"
# LEAVE THIS BLANK IF USING OPTION 1 or 3 for Google APIs.
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON_PATH=


# --- OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials (Fallback or for local development/testing) ---
# This is used if NEITHER of the Service Account options above are provided.
# This should be the FILENAME of your OAuth 2.0 client secrets JSON file 
# (downloaded from Google Cloud Console when you create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials).
# Place this JSON file (e.g., "client_secret_google_apis.json")
# in the root of the barged_api project directory (alongside this .env file).
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_JSON_FILENAME="your_oauth_client_secret_filename.json"


# --- Google Drive Configuration ---
# The ID of the specific Google Drive folder that the application should scan
# for recipe subfolders.
GDRIVE_TARGET_FOLDER_ID="your_actual_gdrive_folder_id_for_recipes"

# --- YouTube Upload Defaults (Optional - Can be overridden by UI/logic later) ---
# Default privacy status for YouTube uploads: "private", "unlisted", or "public"
# YOUTUBE_DEFAULT_PRIVACY_STATUS="unlisted"
